[Task description](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/blob/2018-Q3/tasks/codejam-culture-portal.md)

### Difficulties encountered during development:

- React was a new framework for almost all team members
- In some cases it was quite difficult to integrate multiple different component
- Responsivness
- Difficulty with a React especially with lifecycle and state
- It was really difficult to split work between team members without intercection/merge conflicts in some files
- It is not easy to create basic application architecture at the begining of development
